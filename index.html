            <br/>
            <p>Studying in the UK, my work is driven by a passion for experimentation, blending digital methods with the tactile qualities of fine art. I aim to engage viewers as participants, challenging the boundaries between creator and audience, and reflecting on how technology influences our perceptions and narratives. Through my projects, I seek to contribute to the dialogue on art's evolving role in society, envisioning new possibilities at the nexus of art, technology, and interaction.</p>
